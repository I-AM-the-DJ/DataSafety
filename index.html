            I AM the DJ will be to assist the DJ in music selection, organization, and figuring out the type of crowd/Vibe. This application will bring users with similar tribes/vibes together and put together the best music for them. We will bring likeminded, similar interest individuals together while introducing them to new songs they didn't know they liked or needed.
